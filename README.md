### What makes our bot special?
Well, it is so obvious. The control and precision we were able to get when controlling on the track was the speciality. Thanks to the Analog Joystick we designed 
with all the interfacing codes and all, such a record breaking timing was possible.

### Motivation for their Idea and their XLR8 Journey
Two pairs of roomies coming together to make a bot was how it started. We started early, with the goal of putting our time to the best use possible. We started working 
on the bot control using differential drive, and the Joystick/Digital Control at the same time. We first test ran our bot with the Digital Control, then started debugging
and improving the control according to how the pro-gamers in our team, Vedika and Ishaan, wanted it to be. We brainstormed ideas and finally got the Analog Control 
working. We soldered the connections, made the bot compact and tried to resolve any possibilities of the bot faulting on the track (it became even reasonably fall-proof at 
last). On the day of final run, we even added a solid mover to the front of our bot to successfully complete the suprise task. It was a fun-filled experience which we 
are glad to be a part of.

###Help received from mentor
Our mentor was our pillar of support throughout the course of building the bot. He helped us resolve many bugs and also tracked our progress very often.

###Technical Details:
Please find the reports, codes flashed into the ESP32s, and photos/videos of our endeavor in the repo.
